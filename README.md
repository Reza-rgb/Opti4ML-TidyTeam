# Opti4ML-TidyTeam

Each notebook.ipynb was structured the following way :

Analysis of Clean / Vanilla Dataset
* Base Case
* Curriculum Learning (Cumulative and Strict versions when noisy dataset)
* Strict Curriculum Learning
* Hard-Example Mining
* Reverse Curriculum Learning
* Stratified Monte-Carlo Sampling

Both MNIST and CIFAR_10 notebooks contains two noisy versions of the basic dataset, implemented with Gaussian and Impulse Noise, on which the same models where tested.
